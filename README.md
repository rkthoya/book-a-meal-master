## Introduction
The project entails having a caterer as the site administrator and can add 
meals to the application as well as set menus for a particular day. 
The customers, after signing up first, are then allowed to book meals online.

## The Client Side
This is the frontend part of the application and will involve building from 
the ground up a user interface without the use of UI frontend frameworks such 
as Bootstrap or Foundation. 

The color palette was generated using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) which 
is a tool for generating non-crashing colors.

The wireframes are built using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/).

### Color Palette
The following is the chosen scheme:

### Pages
Here we will show the wireframes of the main pages. 
The heirarchy of the application is as follows:

![Map](https://image.ibb.co/gwHiWx/map.png)

The web application will have the following pages:

#### Landing Page
This will be the first page any user of the application will land on. 
The following is the the wireframe of this page:

![Landing Page Wireframe](https://image.ibb.co/irri6n/landing_page.png)

From here the user can either choose to login or sign up as well as see some 
of the menus available for that particular day.

#### Sign Up Page
This will be used to create an account by a new user.
The  following is this page's wireframe:

![Sign Up Page Wireframe](https://image.ibb.co/eYR4z7/sign_up.png)

**Note**: The administrator does not sign up and he/she will have a default
account.

#### Login Page
This page will be used by both the adminstrator(the caterer) and the 
customers. The two will be differentiated using roles on the server.

## The Server Side

This application uses Flask Python web microframework to create a RESTful 
API.

**Note**: The documentation for the API is 
[here](https://mealbooking.docs.apiary.io)

### Installation

To have the API running, you will have to have `pipenv` package manager. To 
install this, run the following command:
```
$ pip install pipenv
```
Then, change directory to the `/API` where the application code is located.
```
$ cd API
```
Next, you have to install the applications dependancies.
```
$ pipenv install
```

### Configuration

This application requires some configuration held in the `.env` file.
For this, the `.envexample` file has already been provided and you simply have
to copy paste it to `.env` file. That is:
```
$ cp .envexample .env
```

Then, ensure you **fill in the required values** in the configuration file.



### Running

This part assumes you have already configured your application as described 
above. To access the virtual enviroment created by `pipenv`, run:
```
$ pipenv shell
```
This will load the environment variables and create your virtual environment.  
To run your application, simply run:
```
$ flask run
```
You should then have your application up and running:
```
 * Serving Flask app "run" 
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit) 
```

### Testing

The application was built using TDD pattern and therefore has tests that can
be run using `nose` test runner. To run these tests, simply run `nosetests`:
```
$ nosetests test_endpoints.py
```
